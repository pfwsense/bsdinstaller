--
-- The monolithic default configuration file for the BSD Installer.
--
-- Many of the defaults in here are appropriate to DragonFly BSD,
-- but only because that platform is where the installer is
-- developed, and there is no other "default" for many of these
-- things (except perhaps 4.4BSD-LITE.)
--
-- This file can (and should) be partially overridden by further,
-- operating system- and product-specific configuration files.
--
-- Settings can also be set or overridden from the command line like so:
--    fake_execution=true dir.root=/usr/release/root
--

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Application Settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------

--
-- app_name: name of the application.
--

app_name = "BSD Installer"

--
-- log_filename: the file to which logs will be recorded.
-- This exists under dir.tmp.
--

log_filename = "installer.log"

--
-- dir: a table of important directories.
--
-- dir.root is where all commands are assumed to be located, and where
-- all system files are copied from.
--
-- dir.tmp is the temporary directory.
--

dir = {
	root	= "/",
	tmp	= "/tmp/"
}

-- Installation Parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------------

--
-- os: table which describes the operating system.
-- Required, but no default value is given, so it is necessary
-- that some other configuration file override these entries.

os = {
	name = "FreeBSD",
	version = "12.1"
}


--
-- product: table which describes the product which is being installed;
-- if not given, the product is assumed to be the operating system.
--

product = {
	-- no spaces here, used for disk label
	name = "PFWsense",
	version = "21.1"
}


--
-- Name of the install media in use.  Usually "LiveCD", but could be
-- "CompactFlash card", "install disk", etc.
--
media_name = "LiveCD"


--
-- install_items: description of the set of items that are to be
-- installed.   Each item represents a file or directory to copy,
-- and can be specified with either:
--   o  a string, in which case the source has the same name as the dest, or
--   o  a table, with "src" and "dest" keys, so that the names may differ.
-- (A table is particularly useful with /etc, which may have configuration
-- files which produce significantly different behaviour on the install
-- medium, compared to a standard HDD boot.)
--
-- Either way, no leading root directory is specified in names of files
-- and directories.
--
-- Note that specifying (for example) "usr/local" will only copy all of
-- /usr/local *if* nothing below /usr/local is specified.  For instance,
-- if you want copy all of /usr/local/ *except* for /usr/local/share,
-- you need to specify all subdirs of /usr/local except for /usr/local/share
-- in the table.

--
-- cleanup_items: list of files to remove from the HDD immediately following
-- an installation.  These may be files that are simply unwanted, or may
-- impede the functioning of the system (because they came from the
-- installation system, which may have a different configuration in place.)
--
-- On the DragonFlyBSD LiveCD, for example, /boot/loader.conf contains
--   kernel_options="-C"
-- i.e., boot from CD-ROM.  This is clearly inapplicable to a HDD boot.

-- {
--   mountpoint = "/foo",    -- name of mountpoint
--   capstring  = "123M"     -- suggested capacity
-- }
--
-- Note that the capstring can be "*" to indicate 'use the
-- rest of the partition.')
--
-- Typically this function returns a different list of mountpoint
-- descriptions based on the supported capacity of the device.
--
-- As a somewhat special case, this function may return {}
-- (an empty list) to indicate that there simply is not enough
-- space on the device to install anything at all.
--

-- Extra Flow.Steps and Menu.Items can always be added by adding Lua
-- scriptlets to their container directories; however, it is more awkward to
-- delete existing Steps and Items which may be inapplicable in a particular
-- distribution.  So, this file can be used to globally ignore (or otherwise
-- alter the meaning of) individual Steps and Items.
--
-- This configuration file should return a table.  Each key in this table
-- should be a regular expression which will match the id of the Step or
-- Item; the associated value is a control code which indicates what do
-- with all Steps and Items so matched.
--
-- The only supported control code, at present, is "ignore", indicating
-- that the Step or Item should be skipped; this is, not be executed as
-- part of the Flow, or not be displayed as part of the menu.
--
-- NOTE!  Ignoring Flow.Steps properly is more problematic than ignoring
-- Menu.Items, because Steps often rely on a change of state caused by a
-- previous Step.  Configure this table (and write your own Steps) with
-- that fact in mind.
