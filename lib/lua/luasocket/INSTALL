It should be easy to build LuaSocket. Just as an example, I am providing my
makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X and Visual C.NET. The Linux makefile can be
used for AIX, SunOS, and IRIX too, with little modification.  These build
two shared libraries: one for luasocket and one for mime.

LuaSocket 2.0 uses the new package proposal for Lua 5.1. All Lua library
developers are encouraged to update their libraries so that all libraries
can coexist peacefully and users can benefit from the standardization and
flexibility of the standard.

Please check the installation instructions in the manual for details.
Have fun! 
Diego.
